          <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. <a href='#' target='_blank'>Here's something that's fun.</a> Poor old tree. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?</p>

            <h3>The Kitties to Go Story</h3>
            <p>I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. See there how easy that is. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let's make a happy little mountain now.</p>
            <p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. This painting comes right out of your heart. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. We'll make some happy little bushes here.</p>
